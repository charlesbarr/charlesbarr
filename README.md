### Configuration notes
Configured 2024-08-18
Instructions via (GitHub Pages main site)[https://pages.github.com]
Selections

- "User or organization site" (alternative: "Project Site")
- Create a repository on GH web interface... that's "public" but I actually
  created a private one
    - Repo creation notes:
        - Set it to private
        - named it "dash"
        - checked "create a README"
        - did not check a license
- Chose "terminal" as the git client I'm using (other options "GitHub Desktop"
  and "I don't know"
- Cloned the repository in the terminal as `git clone
  https://github.com/charlesbarr/dash` although the instructions said to do
`git clone https:github.com/username/username.github.io` accidentally
- Did `cd charlebarr.github.io` (apparently "dash" didn't make a differene"
- Did `echo Hello World > index.html`
- `git add --all`
- `git commit -m "Initial commit"
- `git push -u origin main` after trying `git push -u origin master` (I had
  changed to using "master" as my default repo, but perhaps that's not how this
works with github pages"
- and since I'm done I visited the page at https://username.github.io but I'm a
  moron and visited https://github.com/charlesbarr/dash which looks like a
regular repo
